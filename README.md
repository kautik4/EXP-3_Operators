# Operators in C++

This repository contains examples and explanations of various operators in C++. Operators are the building blocks of C++ programming, used to perform operations on variables and data. Understanding these operators is essential for writing efficient C++ programs.

## Introduction

In C++, operators are symbols that tell the compiler to perform specific mathematical, logical, or manipulative tasks. Each operator has a unique role and syntax, and this repository aims to provide a clear understanding of these operators through practical code examples.

## Operators Covered

### 1. **Arithmetic Operators**
   - **Addition (+)**: Adds two operands.
   - **Subtraction (-)**: Subtracts the second operand from the first.
   - **Multiplication (*)**: Multiplies two operands.
   - **Division (/)**: Divides the first operand by the second.
   - **Modulus (%)**: Returns the remainder of a division.

### 2. **Relational Operators**
   - **Equal to (==)**: Checks if two operands are equal.
   - **Not equal to (!=)**: Checks if two operands are not equal.
   - **Greater than (>)**: Checks if the first operand is greater than the second.
   - **Less than (<)**: Checks if the first operand is less than the second.
   - **Greater than or equal to (>=)**: Checks if the first operand is greater than or equal to the second.
   - **Less than or equal to (<=)**: Checks if the first operand is less than or equal to the second.

### 3. **Logical Operators**
   - **Logical AND (&&)**: Returns true if both operands are true.
   - **Logical OR (||)**: Returns true if at least one operand is true.
   - **Logical NOT (!)**: Reverses the logical state of its operand.

### 4. **Bitwise Operators**
   - **AND (&)**: Performs bit-by-bit AND operation.
   - **OR (|)**: Performs bit-by-bit OR operation.
   - **XOR (^)**: Performs bit-by-bit XOR operation.
   - **NOT (~)**: Inverts all bits.
   - **Left shift (<<)**: Shifts bits to the left.
   - **Right shift (>>)**: Shifts bits to the right.

### 5. **Assignment Operators**
   - **Assignment (=)**: Assigns the right-hand operand's value to the left-hand operand.
   - **Plus equals (+=)**: Adds right-hand operand to the left-hand operand and assigns the result.
   - **Minus equals (-=)**: Subtracts right-hand operand from the left-hand operand and assigns the result.
   - **Multiply equals (*=)**: Multiplies the left-hand operand by the right-hand operand and assigns the result.
   - **Divide equals (/=)**: Divides the left-hand operand by the right-hand operand and assigns the result.

### 6. **Increment and Decrement Operators**
   - **Increment (++)**: Increases the operand’s value by one.
   - **Decrement (--)**: Decreases the operand’s value by one.

### 7. **Other Operators**
   - **Conditional (?:)**: Ternary operator for condition evaluation.
   - **Comma (,)**: Used to separate two or more expressions.
   - **Sizeof**: Returns the size of a variable or data type.
   - **Pointer operators (&, *)**: Used to access memory addresses and pointer values.
